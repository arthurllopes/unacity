## About The Project

Basically, the project is a platform to show stores and services available in a small city. I also have a contact page to send directly emails to me which is working, I used Google smpt server to do so.

Here's why:
* People from the city may be looking for a new store to buy from.
* Be able to know if a store has delivery service, its contact information, localization, and its service hours.
* Marketing for the store owners.
